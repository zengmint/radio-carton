# Radio Cartón

Radio Cartón is a streaming site for animated cartoons in a radio version. This project uses web technology to create an online news program where two hosts, who have parked their spaceship at a bar, provide funny reports and comments. Radio Cartón stands out as an audiovisual project idea that allows real-time interaction with the editor.
